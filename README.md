# Collatz
Program that calculates the collatz conjecture for a given interval and finds the longest chain.

##Collatz Conjecture
The Collatz Conjecture (AKA the 3n+1 conjecture) is this idea that if you choose
a natural number, n, and apply the following formula

    *f*(n) = {n/2 if n%2 = 0 or 3n+1 if n%2 = 1}

enough times, you will eventually reach 1.
